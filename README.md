Ensure required libraries are installed: 

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sounddevice pyrtlsdr

Using sample code available on the PySDR website (https://pysdr.org/index.htmlLinks to an external site.), develop code for detection, filtering, and Fourier Analysis of various FM radio stations. Develop code to acquire a radio signal for a period, process the audio signal, and output the sound. (Does not need to be real time)

Make observations regarding filter specifications, acquisition duration, and device tuning related to quality of the audio signal and the role detection time plays in the Fourier Analysis of the signal.

Process the dataset to provide filtering for extraction of audio signal.

Process the dataset to provide Fourier Analysis of the Acquired signal both prior to and after filtering steps (provide a Figure of each)

Include a file that has your raw recorded radio signal and a file that includes the audio output of that signal with and without your designed filter.



Provide a write-up describing:

- Processing Methods

- Filter design decisions
  
- Observations of Fourier Analysis steps
  
- Challenges you encountered while doing the project.
  
- Is there a better method for processing the data than Fourier Analysis for providing context of speech?
